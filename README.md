# coding-challenge
A repo containing code for a coding challenge.



## Security
By default, the private canned ACL is used.  This can be overridden.

Since this is a coding challenge and I don't really know where it might be deployed for testing, I did not apply a policy to the S3 bucket.  Normally I would do this.
